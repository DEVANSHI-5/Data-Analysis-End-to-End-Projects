# Miami Shops — Quick 45-Minute Data Project

I built a small end-to-end analytics project in **45 minutes**:

- Imported the dataset into **MySQL Workbench**
- Queried key metrics using SQL
- Loaded the results into a **Power BI dashboard**
- Answered simple but meaningful business questions using clear visuals

## 🔍 Insights I explored

- 🌞 Hot days boost sales, rainy days slow them down  
- 🏝 One Miami shop consistently outperforms the rest — especially in summer  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Families vs singles shop differently across weekdays & weekends  
- 📅 Clear seasonal shopping patterns useful for planning & staffing  

## 🚀 Tools Used
